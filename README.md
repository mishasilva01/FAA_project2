### Information from e-learning:
Critical bending moment of uniform and tapered beams. Compare the Neural Network model and the Linear/Polynomial Regression to predict critical bending moment based on 9 features.
</br>Based on the article by Couto, Carlos. "Neural network models for the critical bending moment of uniform and tapered beams." Structures. Vol. 41. Elsevier, 2022
